// For Felicity: this will be where you code your HTML for the footer

// To start the website server: type "npm start" into your terminal
            // Once it gives the message "webpack compiled successfully", go to your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc) and type "localhost:3000"
            // If the website loads successfully, you should be able to see your progress on the Footer component
            // If you want to display a different component, go to "src/views/Homepage/Homepage.js" to edit which component you want to render


// Random Tips
// 1. for information on how to display pictures, on a website, look into "src/components/header/Header.js". I've added comments there to tell you what to do

// How to get the svg data
/**
1. look into "src/components/header/Header.js" for guidance on how to display pictures on a website
    a. First we need to get the svg data from the image and make it a .svg file under "src/assets"
    b. Go to figma and click the image you want to extract the data from. 
    c. Once only the image is selected, go to the outline on the left and look at whichever component is highlighted.
    d. Right click on that component, click "Copy/Paste as" and then "Copy as SVG".
    e. Create a new file under "src/assets" <picture-name>.svg, and then Paste everything into the file. Remember to save!
    f. Coming back to Footer.js, remember to import the svg file at the top (look into Header.js as to how to do that)
    e. Inside the html, insert an img tag and use your svg file as the source. (also look into Header.js for more info)
